The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable 
source of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 4 MW (i.e., 4000kWp) is 
installation and operation of solar power plant at Village – Sara, Taluka – Muli, in Surendranagar 
district in the state of Gujarat are per details listed below:

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 8,760 MWh of electricity per 
annum considering an average PLF of 25%. The project activity uses Monocrystalline Goldi solar 
photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a 
clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process. 
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an 
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV 
generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project activity 
leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity generation in 
the regional grid.
